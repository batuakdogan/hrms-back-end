# Security Policy

## Introduction

The security of the HRMS Back-End project is a high priority. We strive to follow best practices to keep the application and its data secure. However, it is crucial for users to be aware of the project's current maintenance status.

**⚠️ Project Status Warning**

This project has not been actively maintained since **May 2021**. As a result, its dependencies (including the Spring Boot framework, security libraries, and others) are significantly outdated. These old versions may contain known security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer releases.

**Before using this code in any environment, especially production, it is strongly recommended that you:**
1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Update all Maven dependencies to their latest stable versions.
3.  Perform a thorough security audit of the code and its dependencies.

## Supported Versions

As the project is not in active development, there are no versions currently receiving security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| `1.0.x` | :x: Not Supported  |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take all security reports seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us privately.

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use **GitHub's Private Vulnerability Reporting feature** to submit your report.

**[>> Report a vulnerability here <<](https://github.com/batuakdogan/hrms-back-end/security/advisories/new)**

This ensures that the vulnerability is disclosed responsibly and allows time for it to be addressed before it becomes public.

### What to Include in a Report

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much detail as possible, including:

*   **A clear and descriptive title.**
*   **A detailed description** of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
*   **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability, including any proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or screen recordings.
*   The **version of the code** you are using (if applicable).
*   Any **suggestions for mitigation** you may have.

### Our Commitment

While this project is not actively maintained, we encourage responsible disclosure through the private reporting channel. Using GitHub's built-in reporting tool is the most appropriate and secure method for disclosure. Due to the inactive nature of this project, we cannot guarantee a specific response time, but all private reports will be reviewed.

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.
